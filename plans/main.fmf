summary: Example of working with Snapshots from RHTAP

    package:
      # For working with the SNAPSHOT var
      - jq
      # Just for interacting with the images
      - podman

execute:
    # Note, the ' character works here because the ${SNAPSHOT} is not a shell
    # environment variable. it is treated by tmt as a tmt variable which is
    # injected into the script before it is evaluated by bash.

        echo "This is where the test script goes."

        echo "The base64 encoded snapshot is: ${SNAPSHOT}"
        echo -n "The base64 decoded snapshot is: "

        echo "It contains the following container images:"

        IMAGES=$(echo '${SNAPSHOT}' | base64 -d | jq -r '.components[].containerImage')

        # Then, perform some check
        for IMAGE in $IMAGES; do
            podman run $IMAGE cat /etc/os-release
        done
